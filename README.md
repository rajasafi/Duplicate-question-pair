Training a Model to Finding Duplicate Question Pair

* The goal of this model is to predict whether pairs of provided questions have the same meaning or not.
* The dataset includes ground truth labels supplied by human experts.
* The labels are subjective because the true meaning of sentences cannot be known with absolute certainty.
* Human labeling is a 'noisy' process and can lead to discrepancies in opinions.
Therefore, while the ground truth labels are considered to be 'informed', they may not be entirely accurate and could contain incorrect labeling.
* It is important to note that the labels in this dataset are intended to represent a reasonable consensus, but there may be cases where they do not reflect the true meaning of individual items in the dataset.
* As the task involves determining whether two questions have the same meaning, it is important to consider not only the words used in the questions but also their context.
* The ground truth labels provided by human experts are based on their interpretation of the questions and their understanding of the language used.
* Since language is complex and often nuanced, it is possible that different experts may have different opinions on whether two questions have the same meaning or not.
Therefore, the ground truth labels should be considered as a guide rather than an absolute truth.
* We should be aware of the subjectivity of the labels and use their own judgment in evaluating the questions.
* They should also consider that there may be cases where the ground truth labels are incorrect or do not accurately reflect the meaning of the questions.
